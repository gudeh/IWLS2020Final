# IWLS 2020 Contest - UFSC, team CGP!

This code stores a Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) implementation designed to solve the IWLS 2020 contest with a Machine Learning technique. This implementation is based on an evolutive design, inspiered by the evolution of living beings. The CGP is composed of a set of individuals, also known as population, and their genetic code is stored in a matrix format, which is a cartesian description of connections the individuals have with each other. Each individual in this particular implementation represents a circuit to be discovered. Where the contest exposes a partial (tiny most of the times) behaviour of each circuit in PLA files. In this implementation, the CGP nodes are equivalent (most of the time) to AND nodes from the AND-Inverter Graph (AIG) format. The learning with the CGP technique comes from mutations applied during the learning process, individuals have a certain predetermined (and adaptive) chance to mutate at each generation. The individuals are then evlauated after mutations to choose a father to generate the next offspring generation of individuals.

The CGP may initialize its processing with previously created AIGs from other techniques implemented by the team. Such as Decision Trees generated with the Scikit-learn (SK) tool and the Espresso technique from pyEDA, theese require the executable files to be present during the CGP execution. The PLAs provided by the contest are required and there is also the option of using modified PLAs generated by the team. All of theese required files are provided in this git project, although one should attend to proper building of binary files if they fail to run. The ones provided here were built in a linux distribution.

A makefile is not provided (yet), but there is no requirement of instalation of packets aside from a GCC compiler which supports C++11 (and a python installation if one wishes to use the SK initialization). For the compilation of the code a single command is necessary "g++ -std=c++11 \*.cpp \*.h -o file_name" at the CPP file, one may also use the -O0 option for code optimizations provided by the compiler and -fopenmp for usage of threads to provide a parallelization of evaluation of individuals.

It was a great journey and we were able to achieve good results. A lot was done and a lot was learned. The due date asks for a persistent and quick pace to develop the project, something that maybe would not be achieved otherwise. I'd like to thank everyone participating in the team: Cristina Meinhardt, Jonata Tyska, Brunno Abreu, Mateus Grellert and Isac Campos. I would like also to thank the organizing commite of the IWLS contest to provide this great opportunity for us to learn and produce an interesting and useful little system based on Machine Learning. I am relly thankful, this was a great experience and certanly there is still a lot to be explored further! Cheers.
